## Application overview

MyReads is application created for Udacity's FEND course. 
It allows to manage your virtual library.

## How the application works

Application is made of three pages: 

1. Main page with three shelves:
  - Read
  - Want To Read
  - Currently Reading
2. Search page - you can search for books by chosen terms and then put them in your library
3. NotFound page - which prevents to use unused routes of application

All search terms which you can use are in this file:[Search terms](https://github.com/Grzegon/FEND_MyReads/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md)
